The aim of this project is to create a replacement library for the original Stanford version which is only available for windows and mac but not for *nix users.

I think it is really awesome that Stanford makes the course available free of charge to anyone who is interested and owns either a mac or a windows box and I feel left out being a linux guy.
The libraries on the course website are compiled and the source files are not available so the only thing I can do if I want to do the course is to create my own version of the library. Luckily the header files are available and there is a good description of what is doing what.

This is the link to the course website: http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx
It is called Programming Abstractions, CS106B

The implementation here is a work in progress and it is far from being complete. So far I only managed to do three of the files which is just enough to do the very first assignment.

If you feel you want to help out just let me know. Comments, suggestions, bug reports and contributions are welcome.
